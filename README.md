# UoM_MapReduce-vs-Spark

This repository contains the Spark and MapReduce results in separate folders. It also includes a comparison between them. Please note that I had to multiply the Spark time by 100 due to visualization issues when comparing it with MapReduce time results.

The Spark method was executed using AWS EMR, and an additional step was added following [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs.html).

MapReduce was executed by logging into the EMR node using SSH and applying command line commands.
